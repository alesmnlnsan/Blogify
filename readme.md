## Project Details

This project is based on the second unit of our course focusing on full-stack development. Using everything we've learned, we were tasked to create a basic CRUD app of our choice.

I chose a basic blog app that is similar to a social media app that I enjoy using! It has a lot of flaws and is a work in progress but it is functional and ready to use! With Blogify, you can easily sign up, create and publish any blog post you desire. Additionally, you can have a sense of community with the comments section where you can leave reviews and communicate with your fellow bloggers.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Express, EJS, CSS

## Challenges

I faced several challenges during the development of this website. The subject matter was quite challenging for me to grasp initially, and my site often crashed during development. I had difficulty with routing and rewriting. Due to time constraints and some gaps in my knowledge, I couldn't implement everything I had initially planned. However, I managed to complete the essential parts of the project, which is a significant achievement!

## Future Improvements

I want to implement a profile picture system in which the users can upload, edit, delete and update!
