## INTRODUCTION
This project is based on the second unit of our course focusing on full-stack development. Using evrything we've learnt we were tasked to create a basic CRUD app of our choice.

I chose a basic blog app that is similar to a social media app that I enjoy using! It has a lot of flaws and is a work in progress but it is funtional and ready to use! With Blogify, you can easily sign up, create and publish any blog post you desire. Additionally, you can have a sense of community with the comments section where you can leave reviews and communicate with your fellow bloggers.

# Technologies Used
- JavaScript, Node.js, Postgres, Express, EJS, CSS

# Challenges
- I had a lot of difficulties creating this website because the subject wasÂ very difficult for me to grasp. My site often crashed while I was making it. I had a hard time with routing and rewriting. I didn't get to do everything I wanted to do because of time constraints and knowledge shortcomings. I've been sick a lot this week, which made things hard, but I got the big part done, so that's good!
